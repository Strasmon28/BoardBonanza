Boardbonanza is a project clone of the project organizing site, Trello.      
Here at BoardBonanza, users can create simple, yet highly customized planning boards for all their planning needs.

# Personal Dashboard
Users have a personal dashboard containing all their planning boards.

# Board Creation and Customization
Users can name their boards and have plenty of color themes to choose from including solid color options and even more stylish gradient options.      

Users can add cards within their boards to plot down project idea, and can add sub labels within those cards for idea points. Each of these can be further customized to assist and organize with project planning or just to add a little desired flair.
